# Ruby on Rails and Elasticsearch: Example application

Надо выполнить следующие команды
```
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
rails db:seed
rails s
```

This application is an example of integrating the Elasticsearch
search engine with the Ruby On Rails web framework.

It has been generated by application templates available at
https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/main/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates.

## Basic

The `basic` version provides a simple integration for a simple Rails model, `Article`, showing how
to include the search engine support in your model, automatically index changes to records,
and use a form to perform simple search require 'requests.'
